# Project Structure

The project follows the standard Maven directory layout for Web applications (https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html)

All Java source code will be contained in src/main/java/com/cis498/group4/. Controller servlets will be placed in com.cis498.group4.controllers and model objects will be placed in com.cis498.group4.models.

The source folder for the web root is src/webapp/. All JSP, HTML, CSS, images, Javascript, etc. will go in this folder and its subdirectories (e.g. /img, /scripts, etc.). JSP views should go in /views. Partial JSP views (e.g. "_header.jsp") should go in /templates.
